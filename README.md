# HealthLens

Health Lens is a iOS HealthKit application that allows users to export and analyze their health data. The goal with HealthLens is to be the missing "export" button for health-related data for data-obsessed users looking for personalized analytics.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for Health Lens comes from my brother, Matthew, who once exclaimed that he "wanted a Power BI dashboard for his health". For those unfamiliar, [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi) is [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) for people lacking taste. 

Despite the poor choice in visualization software, I was frustrated by the lack of quality data connectors for Apple Health data. Being so inspired, I waited an entire year to start HealthLens.  

## Roadmap

Apple Health is a data-warehouse for personal health information. However, the visualization and analysis tools provided are lackluster (at least for those as metric-obsessed as I). Health Lens seeks to facilitate the missing visualization and analysis layer for Apple Health.

Initially, Health Lens  will be simple export of health data to common formats like CSV and XLSX. However, great-support for native visualizations through products like [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts) is a future goal. 

In addition to being an iOS app, I will seek to showcase some analysis which I have found meaningful.
